To resolve the specificity issue, ensure the selector with the intended style has higher specificity.

Here's a corrected version:

```css
div p {
  color: blue !important; /*Use !important carefully*/
}
p {
  color: red;
}
```

Alternatively, adjust the structure to avoid specificity conflicts or be more explicit with selectors:

```css
.specific-paragraph {
  color: red;
}
div .specific-paragraph {
  color: blue;
}
```

By using a class, we ensure the intended style has precedence.  Always prefer structural adjustments to `!important` for better maintainability.
